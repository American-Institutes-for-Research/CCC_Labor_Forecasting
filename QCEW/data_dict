wages_qtr = total wages paid to all employees in the quarter - changes with yr.qtr
estabs_qtr = number of unique establishments - changes with yr.qtr
ownership = ownership category of corresponding data row. Either private, federal, state, or local.

Zero values are copied directly from the source file. Some estimates are suppressed due to privacy concerns stemming from low
establishment counts. In other cases, estimates appear in one year but not the following, and vice versa.

Missing/NaN values mean the corresponding NAICS code is not found in the corresponding year-level file.
