Students will be introduced to the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) which is a device that is capable of being programmed to perform control functions. The first PLC was introduced in the late 1960s to replace relay logic controls in the automotive industry. Compared to relay logic controls, the PLC's advantages include easy programming and installation, high control speed, hardware and software security, network compatibility, troubleshooting and testing convenience, and high reliability. PLCs are currently used widely in industrial and commercial environments. They can be found in almost any manufacturing facility. There are several manufacturers of PLCs.
